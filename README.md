## 📌 Project Overview

With the growing popularity of bikes for health, environmental, and economic reasons, it's essential to understand what drives customers to purchase them. This project analyzes a demographic and behavioral dataset to uncover patterns in purchase decisions. An interactive Excel dashboard summarizes the findings, making it easy to explore and communicate insights.

## 🎯 Project Objective

The main goal is to determine the key attributes that affect whether a customer is likely to purchase a bike. Using Excel tools like pivot tables, slicers, and charts, we identify correlations between purchase behavior and factors such as:

- Age and gender
- Income and home ownership
- Commute distance
- Regional distribution
- Education and occupation

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset consists of **1,000** customer records and includes the following features:

- **Demographic**: Age, Gender, Marital Status, Number of Children
- **Economic**: Income, Home Ownership, Number of Cars
- **Behavioral**: Commute Distance, Region
- **Purchase Decision**: Bike Purchase (Yes/No)

> 📁 _Note: The dataset used is publicly available and anonymized._

## 🔧 Tools and Techniques Used

- Microsoft Excel
  - Pivot Tables
  - Slicers and Filters
  - Interactive Charts
  - Conditional Formatting
- Data Cleaning & Preprocessing (within Excel)

## 📈 Excel Dashboards

The project includes 4 main dashboards:

1. **Demographic Impact Dashboard**
2. **Economic Factors Dashboard**
3. **Behavioral and Lifestyle Dashboard**
4. **Executive Summary Dashboard**

These dashboards provide interactive, visual representations of trends and patterns in the dataset.

## 🔍 Key Insights

- **Top Age Group**: 35–44 years
- **Most Active Region**: North America
- **High Income Influence**: Upper-Middle income buyers dominate
- **Commute Preference**: Shorter commute distance (0–1 miles) correlates with bike purchase

9. Which education group buys more?
10. Which occupation group is the most active buyer?

## 📌 Recommendations

- Target professionals and upper-middle-income groups with tailored offers

## 📊 Business Impact
