## 📌 Project Overview

With the growing popularity of bikes for health, environmental, and economic reasons, it's essential to understand what drives customers to purchase them. This project analyzes a demographic and behavioral dataset to uncover patterns in purchase decisions. An interactive Excel dashboard summarizes the findings, making it easy to explore and communicate insights.

## 🎯 Project Objective

The main goal is to determine the key attributes that affect whether a customer is likely to purchase a bike. Using Excel tools like pivot tables, slicers, and charts, we identify correlations between purchase behavior and factors such as:

- Age and gender
- Income and home ownership
- Commute distance
- Regional distribution
- Education and occupation

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset consists of **1,000** customer records and includes the following features:

- **Demographic**: Age, Gender, Marital Status, Number of Children
- **Economic**: Income, Home Ownership, Number of Cars
- **Behavioral**: Commute Distance, Region
- **Purchase Decision**: Bike Purchase (Yes/No)

> 📁 _Note: The dataset used is publicly available and anonymized._

## 🔧 Tools and Techniques Used

- Microsoft Excel
  - Pivot Tables
  - Slicers and Filters
  - Interactive Charts
  - Conditional Formatting
- Data Cleaning & Preprocessing (within Excel)

## 📈 Excel Dashboards

The project includes 4 main dashboards:

1. **Demographic Impact Dashboard**
2. **Economic Factors Dashboard**
3. **Behavioral and Lifestyle Dashboard**
4. **Executive Summary Dashboard**

These dashboards provide interactive, visual representations of trends and patterns in the dataset.

## 🔍 Key Insights

- **Top Age Group**: 35–44 years
- **Most Active Region**: North America
- **High Income Influence**: Upper-Middle income buyers dominate
- **Commute Preference**: Shorter commute distance (0–1 miles) correlates with bike purchase
- **Education Impact**: Bachelor’s degree holders are more likely to purchase
- 

## 📌 Recommendations

- Focus campaigns on customers aged 35–44
- Highlight biking as an ideal short-distance commute solution
- Create regional promotions in North America
- Target professionals and upper-middle-income groups with tailored offers

## 📊 Business Impact

This analysis can help businesses:

- Optimize marketing strategies
- Personalize product offerings
- Identify new target segments
- Reduce wasted advertising spend

## ✅ Conclusion

This project illustrates how simple yet powerful tools like Excel can turn raw customer data into strategic business intelligence. Through structured dashboards and focused insights, the analysis helps businesses make informed, data-driven decisions.
